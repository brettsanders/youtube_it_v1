1. Enter youtube Username
2. Creates User record
3. Redirects to User showpage ... get pretty URLs later
  -> localhost:9797:user/1
4. User homepage has all index
5. Worry about styling these later


For now, I want a custom background image chosen by user
  Has Default Image Until Click Custom
  ex. Joy Division
    Can Choose Font Colors, Font, etc
    Just links to Youtube Playlist
